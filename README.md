## **Features**  

### **Essential Features:**  
- Retrieve a list of all movies.  
- Get details about a specific movie, genre, or director.  
- User registration and profile updates.  
- Manage a list of favorite movies (add/remove).  
- Deregister user accounts.  

### **Optional Features:**  
- View additional movie details (e.g., ratings, release dates).  
- Create a "To Watch" list.  
- View information about actors.

## **Technical Stack**  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL)  
- **Business Logic**: Mongoose  
- **API Format**: RESTful JSON  

---

## **Technical Requirements**  
- **Middleware**: Uses at least three middleware packages (e.g., `body-parser`, `morgan`).  
- **Security**: Includes data validation, user authentication (JWT), and authorization.  
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Heroku, with source code on GitHub.  
- **Testing**: API endpoints tested using Postman.  
- **Compliance**: Follows data security regulations.

## **User Stories**  
- **"As a user, I want to learn about movies, directors, and genres."**  
- **"As a user, I want to save favorite movies and manage my profile."**  

---

## **Deliverables**  
- **Core Features**: Fully functional REST API for myFlix backend.  
- **Deployment**: API hosted and accessible on Heroku.  
- **Documentation**: Project directory includes well-documented source code and dependencies (`package.json`).  

---

## **Next Steps**  
- Build the client-side component using React (Achievement 3).  
- Integrate backend and frontend for a full-stack JavaScript portfolio project (MERN stack).
